        <img src="https://tinyurl.com/y5q3o3ud" alt="Meat-Lovers Pizza"> <h2>#1: Meat-Lovers Pizza</h2><p>The meat lovers pizza is subjectively the best food of all time. The meat perfectly compliments the cheese and the sauce in a way that is insurmountable by any other food. Getting the Meat-Lovers pizza wrong is a very difficult task.</p>

        <img src="https://tinyurl.com/y2gvb7hk" alt="Yummy Burrito"> <h2>#2: Burrito</h2><p>The burrito is a strong runner up for the number one spot. Its versatility combined with the style of food, as well as the base ingredients all guarantee a great eating experience. Burritos are one of the easiest foods to love as you can fully customize it to your liking and eat it however you would like. Overall, the burrito is a solid #2 for the best foods in the world. </p>

    <div>
        <img src="https://tinyurl.com/y4s28csm" alt="Rice Bowl"><h2>#3: Rice</h2><p>Rice is a very controversial food. Its versatility is far better than the burrito as it goes with just about anything, but the taste alone just doesn't compare. Rice can be enjoyed in any way, on anything, at any time and is the perfect food to fill you up and satisfy you no matter what the circumstance. Rice is quick, easy, and affordable. There is no reason not to love rice.</p>
